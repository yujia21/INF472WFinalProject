            <h1>How does this work?</h1><br>
            1. Rate your language skills.<br>
            2. Start a conversation through our message system with someone with a language level similar to yours.<br>
            3. Rate that person's language level! <br>
            4. Get a general rating of your own language skills. <br><br>
            
            <h1>I rated someone wrongly by mistake!</h1><br>
            Don't worry, when your rating is sent out, the person you rated will
            see that you have rated him/her. <br>
            He or she will then approve or reject the rating without knowing the 
            rating you have given him/her. <br>
            If you made a mistake in the level, just rate the person again - 
            our system will automatically update your old rating!<br><br>
            
            <h1>What are the languages supported?</h1><br>
            For the moment, we have: <br>
            1. English<br>
            2. French<br>
            3. Spanish<br>
            4. Portuguese<br>
            5. Italian<br>
            6. German<br>
            7. Chinese<br><br>
            
            <h1>Why these languages?</h1><br>
            Simply because we study in Europe and because these include the languages we speak!<br><br>
